# Genomic dissection of endemic carbapenem resistance: metallo-beta-lactamase gene dissemination through clonal, plasmid and integron transfer pathways
We analysed two decades of *bla*H~IMP-4~ evolution in a hospital using sequence data from 270 clinical and environmental isolates (including 169 completed genomes).

The pre-print publication is available on [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.25.534241v1)

In this repository are the data and the R code needed to generate the mansucript figures. Make sure they are in the same directory to be able to run the R code.

Here you will find R code and input data.

## R code
The R code to generate the figures from the data is in `imp4_manuscript_final_20230613.R`
You may have to install several packages.

## Input data
The remaining files are input data and consist of CSVs with study metadata and phylogenetic trees.

Thank you for reading!
