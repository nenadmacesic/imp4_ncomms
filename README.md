# Genomic dissection of endemic carbapenem resistance: metallo-beta-lactamase gene dissemination through clonal, plasmid and integron transfer pathways
We analysed two decades of blaIMP-4 evolution in a hospital using sequence data from 270 clinical and environmental isolates (including 169 completed genomes).

The pre-print publication is available on bioRxiv [title](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.03.25.534241v1)

In this repository are the data and the R code needed to generate the mansucript figures.

## Input data
Input data are found in the `/data` directory

## R code
The R code to generate the figures from the data is in `imp4_manuscript_final_20230613.R`
